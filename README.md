# Customer-Churn-Prediction using Machihe Learning and Artificial Neural Network
OBJECTIVE:

Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company.As the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one, maintaining a healthy customer base is important for the success of any business.As customers have multiple options in the telecom industry, the churn rate is particularly high in this industry.Individualized customer retention is difficult because businesses usually have a lot of customers and cannot afford to spend much time on one. The costs would be too high and would outweigh the extra revenue.But if a company could predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, they could focus customer retention efforts by directing them solely toward such "high risk" customers.

The main objective of our project was to build a predictive model to generate a prioritized list of customers most vulnerable to churn.Since the entire model is based on detecting the loyalty of  the customers thus we focused one specific field-the tenure ( as you can check out in our code or tutorial as you please) i.e. the customer's intention of staying or leaving the company and so we created two different variables, one for customer's leaving  and for the customer's willing to stay. We perfromed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on the given dataset to see what the dataset has to offer us.

MODEL:

After training and testing our model using Machine Leaning and building an ANN model our accuracy for the model was 0.82(82%). I used accuracy as my main metric.Accuracy which is the number of correctly predicted data points out of all the data points was 0.79(79%).This tells us that the model has correctly identified 79% of customers that actually churned.
